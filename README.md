### How to start

You need replace all the `{{}}` tag to your blog platform's function. Just follow the description in the `<!-- -->` , and don't forget to remove the annotate after you finished it.

You can take Clearision to all the blog platform but just left a link: `<a href="http://blog.dimpurr.com/clearision" title="ClearisionX">ClearisionX</a>`

Have fun!
